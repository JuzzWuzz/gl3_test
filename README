README
======
regl3_test  is basically just me trying to create a simple framework to try out SDL1.3 and OpenGL 3.0...  Nothing much interesting.

BUILD
=====

Dependencies
 * SDL 1.3 (download from www.libsdl.org)
 * OpenGL 3.0

Just run the make file and all should work. its not exactly complicated.


TODO
====
 * Add in the default shaders via a class for shaders
 * Create functions for making projection, transform matrices and remove those fixed function calls.
